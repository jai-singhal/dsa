# What is a Randomized Algorithm?

An algorithm that uses random numbers to decide what to do next anywhere in its logic is called Randomized Algorithm.. For example, in Randomized Quick Sort, we use random number to pick the next pivot (or we randomly shuffle the array). And in Kargerâ€™s algorithm, we randomly pick an edge.
